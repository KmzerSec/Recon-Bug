reconFTW automates the entire process of reconnaissance for you. It outperforms the work of subdomain enumeration along with various vulnerability checks and obtaining maximum information about your target.

reconFTW uses a lot of techniques (passive, bruteforce, permutations, certificate transparency, source code scraping, analytics, DNS records...) for subdomain enumeration which helps you to get the maximum and the most interesting subdomains so that you be ahead of the competition.
